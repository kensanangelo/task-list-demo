# Task List Demo Project

## How to Run Locally

-  If using `nvm`, run `nvm i` then `nvm use` to install and use the correct version of node
-  `npm i` to install node modules
-  `npm start` to start development server
-  Go to the url shown to access the site (usually `http://localhost:3000`)
-  Tests can be run with `npm test`

## Assumptions

-  The task details are light enough to include in the initial fetch. If we are anticipating more data that may end up being too much for this request in the future, we can discuss adding a separate /details api call to fetch that on opening the task.

## Design Decisions

## Work Breakdown

-  To see the work breakdown, go the the file `work-breakdown.md`.

## Backend Design

-  To see backend design, go to the file `backend-design.md``
