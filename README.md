## How to Run Locally

-  If using `nvm`, run `nvm i` then `nvm use` to install and use the correct version of node
-  `npm i` to install node modules
-  `npm start` to start development server
-  Go to the url shown to access the site (usually `http://localhost:3000`)
-  Tests can be run with `npm test`

## Assumptions

-  We will be adding more task details later that will be too much to get all data in the initial list call, so split it into a separate /detailsAPI call from the initial list

## Design Decisions

## Work Breakdown

-  To see the work breakdown, go the the file `work-breakdown.md`.

## Backend Design

-  To see backend design, go to the file `backend-design.md``
